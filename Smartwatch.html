    <h2>Why Smart Watches for Elders?</h2>
    <p>India's elderly population is projected to reach <strong>192 million by 2031</strong> (Source: <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-will-have-over-192-million-elderly-people-by-2031-report/article67084435.ece" target="_blank">The Hindu</a>). With rising health risks, isolation, and emergency response delays, it's crucial to implement smart monitoring solutions that act proactively rather than reactively.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Shocking Fact:</strong> According to a report by NITI Aayog, nearly <strong>50% of elderly Indians</strong> live with chronic diseases like diabetes, BP, or heart ailments — yet access to continuous monitoring is negligible.

    <h2>Real-Life Impact</h2>
    <p>In a recent news story from Pune, a 78-year-old man was found unconscious due to low sugar levels. Had he been wearing a smart health tracker, his vitals would have triggered alerts and help could’ve arrived much sooner.
